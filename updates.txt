- link appears on bardetails if you're allowed to edit the page

============================================================

Looking towards the future... (ohhhh there's still so much to do!)
... a lot of stuff has to work together to make everything user-friendly and easy to navigate!

[in progress] individual bar edit area
    - bar in-stock list
    - upload menu
    - multiple levels of edit ability (?) (bar owner, calender updates only, etc.) (probably won't be implemented)
    
[in progress] member profiles (post comments, etc)
	- record IP address (in event someone needs to be banned)
    
[in progress] global and individual calendar system (option to include on master list or not)
    - rss feed for master calendar? rss feed for individual calendar?
    - calendar update options (built-in + XML + others?)
    
[in progress] admin area

"updated since your last visit" link

rating system (atmosphere? cost? service? ... other ratings? think of these!)

XML to receive calendar entries (allows option for bar to update this calendar remotely)
    - check to see if XML document is more than 30 minutes old on every page load
    - grab remote XML document if it hasn't been downloaded in last 30 minutes (or hour?)

WAP for cell phones

mass mailer functions

skin updates/make the site cooler looking (AJAX login and calendar?)
	- need pictures of downtown for header
	- new navigation buttons
	- fix rounded border corners (some aren't very rounded)
	- make the index page awesome/eye-catching/easier to read/full of useful information
	- finish "crowd" images (offer new choices other than college/business/mixture?)
	- redo comments skin (rounded corners, better colors)
	- redo events skin (rounded corners, better colors, better spacing)
	- new background? gray is pretty bland.
	- maybe seperate the barpages out a little better? everything runs together
	- picturespicturespicturespicturespicturespictures (rotating header w/ random bars?)
	

utilize google maps!

update the bar listings for them all (get pictures, menus, stock listings, input to database, etc.)

better seperation between template and code

error pages

verify security (sql injections, etc)

message board (?) (will be implemented post-launch if necessary... would require significant changes to user login system)

blog (?) (will be implemented post-launch if it would be useful)
